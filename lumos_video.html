                <h5>Game Premise</h5>
                <p>
                    You are a librarian in the Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Since it's the Harry Potter universe, there is no electricity. 
                    It’s a huge stone castle with dark and dingy corridors. You are about to start your ritual of setting up fire torches for the students 
                    to study. However, you don’t want to set up one too many torches, and neither do you want to deprive any student of the right to study 
                    in the school library. The aim is to light up the place by using a minimum number of torches and placing them optimally in all the 
                    rooms on each floor of the library.
                </p>
                <h5>Game Mechanics</h5>
                <p>
                    Each room in the library represents one level of the game. Each such level would have a different layout of tables, chairs, students, 
                    walls and bookshelves. Some of the rooms would also have a window which means natural light during daytime. A torch need not be placed 
                    near windows. The time of day would also be changed on different levels to increase the permutations for designing a level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player (librarian) enters the room (level) with a lit torch and moves around the room using arrow keys. The torch can be placed 
                    at a desired location by pressing the Spacebar. The Spacebar places a torch at the location and also lights up another one which the 
                    player can move around with to check how it looks, before placing it anywhere. The librarian cannot walk through walls and bookshelves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player can remove a torch placed at any position by left mouse clicking on the torch sprite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each student object in the library would keep track of all the torches placed in the room, and the total light received from these 
                    torches. If this total light was above a threshold, the student sprite would indicate this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each level would have an optimal number of torches to be used. The player would be scored for a level, based on how many torches 
                    the player uses, more or less than the optimal number. If the player uses more than the optimal number of torches, less points 
                    would be awarded, compared to when the player uses less than the optimal number of torches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To add to the challenge in the game, the librarian can also ask any student to rearrange or move to a different table, if it 
                    helps to reduce the number of torches. The student can either choose to comply or not do so. The student would be governed by 
                    the game AI, but it would be deterministically set for each student in each room (level).
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    No player is allowed to see how the other players have arranged their pieces. No changes in the piece arrangement can be made 
                    after the board is revealed to everyone. If the light hits an arc directly, i.e. without interacting with any of the pieces, 
                    that hit does not count if that arc was in a ‘reset’ state, and it gets ‘reset’ if it was in a ‘set’ state. To prevent any player 
                    from gaining unfair advantages of interacting with the light the most, circular tracks are marked on the board which restrict the 
                    number of pieces that can be placed in them. Specifically, the darker grey area in the center prohibits any placement of pieces, 
                    and the light grey area around the center can only have one piece placed in it for each player.
