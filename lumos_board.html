            <h5>Gameboard & Pieces</h5>
            <p>
                Lumos contains a circular board with the circumference divided into 60 arcs. The area of the circular board is divided into 
                as many sectors as there are players which defines the playing area for each player. The 60 arcs are equally and randomly 
                assigned to the players. The board has a light source at the centre which emits light in one single radial direction randomly 
                chosen at each turn. Each player is also given a fixed set of mirrors, lenses and prisms, called ‘pieces’ hereon. (Shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2)
            </p>
            <h5>Rules & Mechanics</h5>
            <p>
                The game is played by turns. At each turn, the board is hidden and all you can see is your assigned sector. All the players 
                arrange their pieces in their allotted playing sector. Once everyone is done arranging their pieces, the board is revealed to 
                everyone. The light source is triggered. It emits light in a randomly chosen radial direction, interacts with the pieces placed 
                by the players in their respective sectors, and eventually hits the circumference of the board along one or more arcs. Those arcs 
                are ‘set’ and the game proceeds to the next round. The objective of the game is to light up all the allocated arcs before everyone 
                else within 20 turns. If the game reaches 20 turns and no one has set all of their arcs, the person with the most arc set wins. 
            </p>
            <p>
                No player is allowed to see how the other players have arranged their pieces. No changes in the piece arrangement can be made 
                after the board is revealed to everyone. If the light hits an arc directly, i.e. without interacting with any of the pieces, 
                that hit does not count if that arc was in a ‘reset’ state, and it gets ‘reset’ if it was in a ‘set’ state. To prevent any player 
                from gaining unfair advantages of interacting with the light the most, circular tracks are marked on the board which restrict the 
                number of pieces that can be placed in them. Specifically, the darker grey area in the center prohibits any placement of pieces, 
                and the light grey area around the center can only have one piece placed in it for each player. 
            </p>
            <h5>Genre, Premise & Story</h5>
            <p>
                Lumos is a strategic board game that has random elements implemented in the game. The premise of the game is set in a wizarding world, 
                all the players are prisoners trapped in a magic castle by a dark wizard. The lock of each prison cell can be opened from a hidden 
                inaccessible circular room by deflecting a certain light that flashes once in a while, onto certain bricks in the wall. Each of these 
                bricks correspond to one lock of your prison cell. You, being a wizard, can place objects that interact with the light, in that room, 
                using magic. However the light in that room is very bright/harsh so it will not affect the locks if it falls on the brick directly. 
                To successfully open the locks to your cell, you need to light up all your bricks only with deflected light which reduces the light 
                intensity. You need to make sure that you do so before the others because the opening of one prison cell will alert the guards and 
                the rest will not be able to get out of the prison in time. There is only enough time for one wizard to escape the prison.
            </p>
            <h5>Challenges & Nuances</h5>
            <p>
                The challenge in the game is to understand how light would interact with the pieces arranged by the players and making sure it hits 
                the desired arcs while avoiding other arcs. Since the light is emitted in a randomly chosen direction, there is unpredictability in 
                terms of how things would turn out after each turn. All that can be done is to arrange the pieces such that the chances of hitting 
                the desired arcs are maximised. Since the arcs allotted to the players need not be adjacent to each other, and in fact different 
                players may have their arcs adjacent to each other, this encourages players to try and create alliances to improve the changes of 
                light hitting their arcs. Further, once an arc is ‘set’, it becomes the responsibility of the owner of that arc to protect it from 
                getting hit directly. However, the arcs of one player (A) can lie in the sector of another player (B), this further calls for more 
                forced alliances to be created and previous alliances to be broken.
