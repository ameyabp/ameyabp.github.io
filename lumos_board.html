                <h4>Gameboard & Pieces</h4>
                <p>
                    Lumos contains a circular board with the circumference divided into 60 arcs. The area of the circular board is divided into 
                    as many sectors as there are players. A sector defines the playing area for each player. The 60 arcs are equally and randomly 
                    assigned to the players. The board has a light source at the centre which emits light in one single radial direction randomly 
                    chosen at each turn. Each player is also given a fixed set of mirrors, lenses and prisms, called ‘pieces’ hereon. For example,
                    as show in Fig. 1, for 6 players, there will be 6 sectors, one for each player. Each sector and thus each player will have 12
                    arcs assigned which can be anywhere along the circumference. 
                </p>
                <h4>Rules & Mechanics</h4>
                <p>
                    The game is played in turns. At each turn, the board is hidden and all you can see is your assigned sector. All the players 
                    arrange their pieces in their allotted playing sector. Once everyone is done arranging their pieces, the board is revealed to 
                    everyone. The light source is triggered. It emits light in a randomly chosen radial direction, interacts with the pieces placed 
                    by the players in their respective sectors, and eventually hits the circumference of the board along one or more arcs. At the start
                    of the game, all the arcs are in a 'reset' state. On being hit by the light beam, the arcs which are in the 'reset' change to 
                    the 'set' state and the game proceeds to the next round. The objective of the game is to light up all your assigned arcs before everyone 
                    else within 20 turns. If the game reaches 20 turns and no one has 'set' all of their arcs, the person with the most number of arcs 'set',
                     wins the game
                </p>
                <p>
                    No player is allowed to see how the other players have arranged their pieces. No changes in the piece arrangement can be made 
                    after the board is revealed to everyone. If the light hits an arc directly, i.e. without interacting with any of the pieces, 
                    that hit does not count if that arc was in a ‘reset’ state, and it gets ‘reset’ if it was in a ‘set’ state. A light beam which has interacted
                    with at least 1 piece hits an arc in the 'set' state, it has no effect on the state of that arc. To prevent any player from gaining 
                    unfair advantages of interacting with the light the most, circular tracks are marked on the board which restrict the number of pieces 
                    that can be placed in them. Specifically, the darker grey area in the center prohibits any placement of pieces, and the light grey 
                    area around the center can only have one piece placed in it for each player. 
                </p>
                <h4>Genre, Premise & Story</h4>
                <p>
                    Lumos is a strategic board game that has elements of randomness implemented in the game. The premise of the game is set in a wizarding world where
                    all the players are prisoners trapped in a magic castle by a dark wizard. Each cel has multiple locks (equal to the number of arcs assigned to each 
                    player). The lock of each prison cell can be opened from a hidden inaccessible circular room (the board game) by deflecting a certain light that 
                    flashes once in a while, onto certain bricks in the wall. Each of these bricks correspond to one lock of your prison cell. You, being a wizard, 
                    can place objects that interact with the light, in that room, using magic. However the light in that room is very bright/harsh so it will not 
                    affect the locks if it falls on the brick directly. To successfully open the locks to your cell, you need to light up all your bricks only 
                    with deflected light which reduces the light intensity. You need to make sure that you do so before the others because the opening of one 
                    prison cell will alert the guards and the rest will not be able to get out of the prison in time. There is only enough time for one wizard 
                    to escape the prison.
                </p>
                <h4>Challenges & Nuances</h4>
                <p>
                    The challenge in the game is to understand how light would interact with the pieces arranged by the players, as shown in Fig. 2 and making sure it hits 
                    the desired arcs while avoiding other arcs. Since the light is emitted in a randomly chosen direction, there is unpredictability in 
                    terms of how things would turn out after each turn. All that can be done is to arrange the pieces such that the chances of hitting 
                    the desired arcs are maximised. Since the arcs allotted to the players need not be adjacent to each other, and in fact different 
                    players may have their arcs adjacent to each other, this encourages players to try and create alliances to improve the chances of 
                    light hitting their arcs. Further, once an arc is ‘set’, it becomes the responsibility of the owner of that arc to protect it from 
                    getting hit directly by the light beam. However, the arcs of one player (A) can lie in the sector of another player (B), this further calls for more 
                    forced alliances to be created and previous alliances to be broken.
