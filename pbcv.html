                    Multidimensional data is difficult to analyse and draw insights from. Although there exist various visualization techniques for understanding multidimensional data, users might
                    not be knowledgeable about those techniques. In this project, we propose an interactive data visualization interface for multidimensional data, specifically for the task of clustering
                    analysis. Further, by making this interface work on interactions based on real life physical forces, we aim to make an intuitive data analysis interface. We use word embeddings as
                    our multidimensional data to implement the interface, with interactions analogous to the effects of temperature, spring forces and electric attraction/repulsion forces. We implement
                    a complete system including a web server in Python Flask and a web client using d3 for visualization. Specifically, we use the D3 Force API for modelling the forces between nodes.

                <h4>Temperature analogy for revealing/hiding fine-grained clusters</h4>
                <p>
                    We use the temperature analog to enable the user to see low level or fine-grained clusters in the word vector space. More temperature usually hints towards an agitated system, which
                    has more energy, more chaos and the individual particles are spread out. With increasing temperature, we split the initial single clustered word vector dataset into hierarchical clusters.
                    This reveals information about which words are used in a similar context, and how different they are from other words. For example, a cluster may contain words related to banking like 
                    'mortgage', 'deferment', 'loan' and words which are used in the context of banking but are also used commonly in other contexts like 'liaison' and 'trust'. At low temperatures, all 5 words 
                    belong to the same cluster, but as the temperature is raised, the two groups of words split into separate clusters.
                </p>
                <h4>Electric field analogy for filtering words</h4>
                <p>
                    We use the electric field analogy to enable the user to find words which are similar to or different from a word of choice. The user can place a word node anywhere in the interface.
                    This newly added node attracts words which are similar to itself or are used in the same context and repels those which are not. These forces mimic the electric field carried by a single
                    charged particle which attracts other charges of the opposite polarity and repels other charges of the same polarity. For example, if a user places the word 'war' in the field, words like
                    'win', 'death', and 'swords' will be attracted, while words like 'light' and 'suitcase' which are nowhere related to wars are repelled.
